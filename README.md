| **[An Fluid Antenna Array-Enabled DOA Estimation Method: End-Fire Effect Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18981v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation serves as a critical sensing technology poised to play a vital role in future intelligent and ubiquitous communication systems. Despite the development of numerous mature super-resolution algorithms, the inherent end-fire effect problem in fixed antenna arrays remains inadequately addressed. This work proposed a novel array architecture composed of fluid antennas. By exploiting the spatial reconfigurability of their positions to equivalently modulate the array steering vector and integrating it with the classical MUSIC algorithm, this approach achieved high-precision DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers outstanding estimation performance even in highly challenging end-fire regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted; Astronomy and Computing</p></details> |
| **[Moment-Matching Array Processing Technique for diffuse source estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15283v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in signal processing. Diffuse sources, whose power density cannot be represented with a single angular coordinate, are usually characterized based on prior assumptions, which associate the source angular density with a specific set of functions. However, these assumptions can lead to significant estimation biases when they are incorrect. This paper introduces the Moment-Matching Estimation Technique (MoMET), a low-complexity method for estimating the mean DOA, spread, and power of a narrow diffuse source without requiring prior knowledge on the source distribution. The unknown source density is characterized by its mean DOA and its first central moments, which are estimated through covariance matching techniques which fit the empirical covariance of the measurements to that modeled from the moments. The MoMET parameterization is robust to incorrect model assumptions, and numerically efficient. The asymptotic bias and covariance of the new estimator are derived and its performance is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive MIMO Radar Architecture for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensing in the D-Band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17110v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The D-band offering an untapped wide bandwidth is promising for high data rate communication and high-resolution wireless sensing. However, these potentials are hindered by the low performance and energy efficiency of the D-band circuits and systems. We present an adaptive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar architecture for energy-efficient wireless sensing in the D-band, leveraging a reconfigurable 2D array of radar transceiver front-ends, a scaling approach for the receiver (RX) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the transmitter (TX) output power ($P_{\rm TX}$) with target distance, and dynamic selection of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm. The reconfigurable radar array, providing an adaptive radar resolution, enhances the energy efficiency by reducing power consumption in the radar RF front-end and lowering the computational complexity in the radar back-end. The RX SNR and the TX output power are scaled with the distance as ${\rm SNR} \propto d^{-p}$ and $P_{\rm TX} \propto d^{4-p}$, where $0 < p < 4$, leading to more efficient resource allocation in varying target distance conditions. Additionally, DOA estimation results using MUSIC and MVDR algorithms indicate that the optimum algorithm, in terms of the accuracy and computational complexity, should be selected based on the number of radar array elements. Furthermore, we develop a hardware model for the MIMO radar RF front-end to evaluate the power consumption of the TX, RX, and local oscillator (LO) distribution network. It is shown that the power consumption of the LO distribution network, which can dominate the power consumption for a large MIMO radar, can be minimized through a distribution strategy for LO amplifiers employed for compensating passive losses. Performance of the adaptive MIMO radar is evaluated in the free-space and the through-wall indoor sensing scenarios in the D-band.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Localization and Power Estimation through RISs: Performance Analysis and Prototype Validations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11420v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the capabilities and effectiveness of backward localization centered on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02820v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |
| **[T-ADD: Enhancing DOA Estimation Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10496v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial perturbations can severely compromise the performance of such models. To address this vulnerability, we propose Transformer-based Adversarial Defense for DOA estimation (T-ADD), a transformer-based defense method designed to counter adversarial attacks. To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Speculative GLRT-Backed Approach for Adversarial Resilience on Deep Learning-Based Array Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09893v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10639v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Decoders for Sensing Subspace Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05028v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse antenna array sensing of source/target via direction of arrival (DoA) estimation motivates design of the sensing framework in joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems for sixth generation (6G) communication systems. Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajamäki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted for presentation at the 59th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |
| **[Nonlinear EM-based Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04595v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of high-frequency bands, combined with antenna arrays containing an extremely large number of elements (XL-MIMO), is pushing current technology to its limits in terms of hardware complexity, latency, and power consumption. A promising approach to achieving scalable and sustainable solutions is to shift part of the signal processing directly into the electromagnetic (EM) domain. In this paper, we investigate novel architectures that harness the interaction of reconfigurable passive linear and nonlinear (NL) scattering elements positioned in the reactive near field of signal sources. The objective is to enable multifunctional linear and NL EM signal processing to occur directly "over-the-air." Numerical results highlight the potential to significantly reduce both system complexity and the number of RF chains, while still achieving key performance metrics in applications such as direction-of-arrival and position estimation, without the need for additional analog or digital processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Covariance-Guided DFT Beam Selection for Beamspace ESPRIT in Hybrid mmWave MIMO Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00898v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider direction-of-arrival estimation in hybrid analog/digital mmWave MIMO receivers that employ DFT beamspace processing with a limited number of RF chains. Building on beamspace ESPRIT, we develop a covariance-guided beam selection framework that reconstructs a virtual fully digital subarray, fits a structured signal-plus-noise covariance model, and uses the resulting denoised covariance to select, for each coarse sector, a small contiguous block of DFT beams under a beam-budget constraint. The selected beams feed a sparse beamspace Unitary ESPRIT stage, so that the overall complexity is dominated by a single low-dimensional ESPRIT call while retaining a large effective aperture. Monte Carlo simulations for a 32-element uniform linear array with three paths show that, relative to a standard sectorization-based beam selector built on the same DFT codebook and ESPRIT estimator, the proposed method attains near Cramér--Rao bound accuracy at moderate array signal-to-noise ratios, substantially reduces the gap to the bound and the failure rate, and offers favorable accuracy--runtime trade-offs under dynamic RF budgets and sector-edge stress tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[DoA Estimation with Sparse Arrays: Effects of Antenna Element Patterns and Nonidealities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23028v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the effects of directional antenna element complex gain patterns and nonidealities in direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. We compare sparse arrays and classical uniform linear arrays, harnessing EM simulation tools to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of both patch and Vivaldi antenna element including mutual coupling effects. We show that with sparse array configurations, the performance impacts are significant in terms of DoA estimation accuracy and operable SNR ranges. Specifically, in the scenarios considered, both the usage of directional antenna elements and a sparse array result in over 90% reduction in average direction finding error, compared to a uniform omnidirectional array with the same number of elements (in this case eight), when estimating the directions of two sources using the MUSIC algorithm. For a fixed angular RMSE, the improvements in array sensitivity are shown to yield a 4 to 15-fold increase in one-way coverage distance (assuming free-space path loss). Among the studied options, the best performance was obtained using sparse arrays with either patch or Vivaldi elements for field of views of 100$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22793v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

| **[LocaGen: Sub-Sample Time-Delay Learning for Beam Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07872v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of LocaGen is to improve the localization performance of audio signals in the 2-D beam localization problem. LocaGen reduces sampling quantization errors through machine learning models trained on realistic synthetic data generated by a simulation. The system increases the accuracy of both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and precise location estimation of an audio beam from an array of three microphones. We demonstrate LocaGen's efficacy on a low-powered embedded system with an increased localization accuracy with a minimal increase in real-time resource usage. LocaGen was demonstrated to reduce DOA error by approximately 67% even with a microphone array of only 10 kHz in audio processing.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Semi-Passive IRS Enabled Sensing with Group Movable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18892v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of the sensing system is limited by the signal attenuation and the number of receiving components. In this letter, we investigate the sensor position selection in a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing system. The IRS consists of passive elements and active sensors, where the sensors can receive and process the echo signal for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Motivated by the movable antenna array and fluid antenna system, we consider the case where the sensors are integrated into a group for movement and derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Then, the optimal solution for the positions of the movable sensors (MSs) to the CRB minimization problem is derived in closed form. Moreover, we characterize the relationship between the CRB and system parameters. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MS scheme over the fixed-position (FP) scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Beamforming for Transmitter Location Privacy in MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09882v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a beamforming framework to ensure transmitter location privacy against sensing-capable MIMO receivers. We propose a novel privacy metric called the direction-of-arrival obfuscation power ratio (DoA-OPR) to design the transmit beamformer. The design approach reshapes the angular power distribution observed at the receiver so that a false direction appears dominant without nulling the line-of-sight (LoS) component. We derive closed-form bounds on the feasible range of DoA-OPR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DoA-OPR constraint. The resulting problem is non-convex but can be efficiently solved using semidefinite relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DoA-OPR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off between location privacy and communication rate. The proposed design attains higher achievable rates than existing LoS-nulling approaches while maintaining comparable location privacy. A suboptimal design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. It achieves a near-optimal communication rate with a reduction of nearly 85%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE ICC 2026 and is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Beam Broadening for DoA Estimation in Dynamic and Resource-Constrained DFRC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16661v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and radio frequency (RF) chains. In this work, we consider a conceptual DFRC scheduler model which shares RF chains between radar and communication functions. If such a scheduler is tuned for prioritizing communication performance, the RF chains and time allocated to radar are less and varying. We propose a practical, low-latency and resource-aware technique for sensing the entire field-of-view (FOV) and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in such settings by leveraging time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing. This results in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better DoA estimation reliability. Extensive simulation studies show that the technique has consistent target detection and angle estimation performance in all directions and adapts to varying resource availability with time.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures 1) Changed system model incorporating abstract DFRC scheduler sharing RF chains 2) Reorganized text/desc. 3) Regenerated plots as per standard parameter settings, used standard colors</p></details> |
| **[Mobile Jamming Mitigation in 5G Networks: A MUSIC-Based Adaptive Beamforming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08046v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Binaural Deep Beamforming With Interpretable Beampatterns Guided by Time-Varying RTF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10168v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, a deep beamforming framework for speech enhancement in dynamic acoustic environments is studied. The time-varying beamformer weights are estimated from the noisy multichannel signals by minimizing an SI-SDR loss. The estimation is guided by the continuously tracked relative transfer functions (RTFs) of the moving target speaker. The spatial behavior of the network is evaluated through both narrowband and wideband beampatterns under three settings: (i) oracle guidance using true RTFs, (ii) estimated RTFs obtained by a subspace tracking method, and (iii) without the RTF guidance. Results show that RTF-guided models produce smoother, spatially consistent beampatterns that accurately track the target's direction of arrival. In contrast, the model fails to maintain a clear spatial focus when guidance is absent. Using the estimated RTFs as guidance closely matches the oracle RTF behavior, confirming the effectiveness of the tracking scheme. The model also outputs a binaural signal to preserve the speaker's spatial cues, which promotes hearing aid and hearables applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A General Ziv-Zakai Bound for DoA Estimation in MIMO Radar Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08326v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper derives a Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in co-located Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems and provides closed-form expressions that hold for multi-target scenarios. Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |
| **[DOA Estimation with Lightweight Network on LLM-Aided Simulated Acoustic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08012v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation is critical in spatial audio and acoustic signal processing, with wide-ranging applications in real-world. Most existing DOA models are trained on synthetic data by convolving clean speech with room impulse responses (RIRs), which limits their generalizability due to constrained acoustic diversity. In this paper, we revisit DOA estimation using a recently introduced dataset constructed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), which provides more realistic and diverse spatial audio scenes. We benchmark several representative neural-based DOA methods on this dataset and propose LightDOA, a lightweight DOA estimation model based on depthwise separable convolutions, specifically designed for mutil-channel input in varying environments. Experimental results show that LightDOA achieves satisfactory accuracy and robustness across various acoustic scenes while maintaining low computational complexity. This study not only highlights the potential of spatial audio synthesized with the assistance of LLMs in advancing robust and efficient DOA estimation research, but also highlights LightDOA as efficient solution for resource-constrained applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consensus Tracking of an Underwater Vehicle Using Weighted Harmonic Mean Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03130v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses an underwater target tracking problem in which a large number of sonobuoy sensors are deployed on a surveillance region. The region is divided into several sub-regions, where a single tracker, capable of generating track is installed. Each sonobuoy can measure the direction of arrival of acoustic signals (known as bearing angles) and communicate the measurements with the local tracker. Further, each local tracker can communicate with all other trackers, where each of them can exchange their estimate and finally a consensus is reached. We propose a weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) based tracking to reach a consensus and provide a solution for the fusion of Gaussian densities. In this approach, optimal weights are assigned by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. Performance of the proposed method is measured using root mean square error, percentage of track divergence, and normalized estimation error squared. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized HMD-based fusion outperforms existing fusion methods during a distributed tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Direction and Diffuseness Estimation Using Tight-Frame Microphone Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22183v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a unified framework for estimating both sound-field direction and diffuseness using practical microphone arrays with different spatial configurations. Building on covariance-based diffuseness models, we formulate a velocity-only covariance approach that enables consistent diffuseness evaluation across heterogeneous array geometries without requiring mode whitening or spherical-harmonic decomposition. Three array types -- an A-format array, a rigid-sphere array, and a newly proposed tight-frame array -- are modeled and compared through both simulations and measurement-based experiments. The results show that the tight-frame configuration achieves near-isotropic directional sampling and reproduces diffuseness characteristics comparable to those of higher-order spherical arrays, while maintaining a compact physical structure. We further examine the accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation based on acoustic intensity within the same framework. These findings connect theoretical diffuseness analysis with implementable array designs and support the development of robust, broadband methods for spatial-sound-field characterization.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages including 14 files</p></details> |
| **[R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11654v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown strong performance in such conditions, they typically lack a mechanism to assess the reliability of their predictions - an essential feature for real-world deployment. In this work, we present the SRP-PHAT-NET, a deep neural network framework that leverages SRP-PHAT directional maps as spatial features and introduces a built-in reliability estimation. To enable meaningful reliability scoring, the model is trained using Gaussian-weighted labels centered around the true direction. We systematically analyze the influence of label smoothing on accuracy and reliability, demonstrating that the choice of Gaussian kernel width can be tuned to application-specific requirements. Experimental results show that selectively using high-confidence predictions yields significantly improved localization accuracy, highlighting the practical benefits of integrating reliability into deep learning-based DOA estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission process to the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 2025</p></details> |

Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing for publication</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary clues such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) or speaker embeddings. However, DOA-based approaches depend on explicit direction estimation and are sensitive to microphone array geometry, while methods based on speaker embeddings model speaker identity in an implicit manner and may degrade in noisy-reverberant conditions. To address these limitations, we propose multi-channel listen to extract (MC-LExt), a simple but highly-effective framework for MC-TSE. Our key idea is to prepend a short enrollment utterance of the target speaker to each channel of the multi-channel mixture, providing an onset-prompted conditioning signal that can guide TSE. This design allows the deep neural network (DNN) to learn spatial and speaker identity cues jointly in a fully end-to-end manner. Experiments on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, including WHAMR! and MC-Libri2Mix, demonstrate the effectiveness of MC-TSE.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods (e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD) incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression (SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in two-dimensional large aperture arrays.</p></details> |  |

However, in practice, the acoustics of the playback room may lead to a noticeable degradation in sound quality. We propose a recording and rendering method based on Ambisonics that utilizes a perceptually-motivated approach to compensate for the reverberation of the playback room. The recorded direct and reverberant sound field components in the spherical harmonics (SHs) domain are spectrally and spatially compensated to preserve the relevant auditory cues including the direction of arrival of the direct sound, the spectral energy of the direct and reverberant sound components, and the Interaural Coherence (IC) across each auditory band. In contrast to the conventional Ambisonics, a flexible number of Ambisonics channels can be used for audio rendering. Listening test results show that the proposed method provides a perceptually accurate rendering of the originally recorded sound field, outperforming both conventional Ambisonics without compensation and even ideal Ambisonics rendering in a simulated anechoic room. Additionally, subjective evaluations of listeners seated at the center of the loudspeaker array demonstrate that the method remains robust to head rotation and minor displacements.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript was submitted to the JASA and is under review</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a spatially filtered sparse Bayesian learning (SF-SBL) framework. Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed.

We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and ``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 5 pages.

A two-stage training strategy is adopted: the model is first trained with single-channel audio and DOA features, and then further optimized with multi-channel inputs under DOA guidance. In addition, a simulated DOA generation scheme is introduced to alleviate dependence on matched multi-channel corpora. On the AliMeeting dataset, SA-S2SND consistently outperform the S2SND baseline, achieving a 7.4% relative DER reduction in the offline mode and over 19% improvement when combined with channel attention. These results demonstrate that spatial cues are highly complementary to cross-channel modeling, yielding good performance in both online and offline settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance, provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Position and Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Based on Euclidean Distance Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02556v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular method to estimate the positions or directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple sound sources using an array of microphones is based on steered-response power (SRP) beamforming. For a three-dimensional scenario, SRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for position estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for multi-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed multi-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable, representing the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs to be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and set of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated absolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each source. The proposed multi-source DOA estimation method entirely eliminates the need for continuous variable optimization by defining a relative coordinate system per source such that one of its coordinate axes is aligned with the respective source DOA. The optimal set of candidate TDOA estimates is determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of a rank-reduced Gram matrix. The computational cost of the proposed EDM-based methods is significantly reduced compared to the SRP-based methods. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations show that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the SRP-based method in terms of two-source position and DOA estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (awaiting review)</p></details> |
| **[Joint DOA and Attitude Sensing Based on Tri-Polarized Continuous Aperture Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02029v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

DeepASA is designed for complex auditory scenes where multiple, often similar, sound sources overlap in time and move dynamically in space. To achieve robust and consistent inference across tasks, we introduce an object-oriented processing (OOP) strategy. This approach encapsulates diverse auditory features into object-centric representations and refines them through a chain-of-inference (CoI) mechanism. The pipeline comprises a dynamic temporal kernel-based feature extractor, a transformer-based aggregator, and an object separator that yields per-object features. These features feed into multiple task-specific decoders. Our object-centric representations naturally resolve the parameter association ambiguity inherent in traditional track-wise processing. However, early-stage object separation can lead to failure in downstream ASA tasks. To address this, we implement temporal coherence matching (TCM) within the chain-of-inference, enabling multi-task fusion and iterative refinement of object features using estimated auditory parameters. We evaluate DeepASA on representative spatial audio benchmark datasets, including ASA2, MC-FUSS, and STARSS23. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both source separation and auditory parameter estimation under diverse spatial auditory scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables, accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In particular, the direction-of-arrival(DoA) of interfering sources is estimated with available snapshots in which the angular sectors of the interfering signals are computed adaptively. Then, we utilize the well-known general linear combination algorithm to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix using preprocessing-based spatial sampling (PPBSS). We demonstrate that the preprocessing matrix can be replaced by the sample covariance matrix (SCM) in the shrinkage method. A power spectrum sampling strategy is then devised based on a preprocessing matrix computed with the estimated angular sectors' information. Moreover, the covariance matrix for the signal is formed for the angular sector of the signal-of-interest (SOI), which allows for calculating an SV for the SOI using the power method. An analysis of the array beampattern in the proposed PPBSS technique is carried out, and a study of the computational cost of competing approaches is conducted. Simulation results show the proposed method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 13 figures, 14 pages |

This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</p></details> |  |

In ISAC systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; 7 figures; tables; 3 tables; manuscript submitted to IEEE journal</p></details> |

Conventional gridless methods often fail in this scenario due to prohibitive computational costs or a lack of robustness. We propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by jointly estimating a manifold transformation matrix and the source azimuth-elevation pairs within a single, unified optimization problem. This problem is solved efficiently using an inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (iALM), which completely circumvents the need for semidefinite programming. By unifying the objectives of data fidelity and transformation robustness, our approach is uniquely suited for the demanding single-snapshot case. Simulation results confirm that the proposed iALM framework provides robust and high-resolution, gridless 2D-DOA estimates, establishing its efficacy for challenging array signal processing applications.</p></details> |  |

This allows for real-time tracking and enhancement of moving sound sources, supporting applications such as speech focus, noise reduction, and world-locked audio in augmented and virtual reality. The method is agnostic to array geometry offering a flexible solution for spatial audio capture and personalized playback in next-generation consumer audio devices.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Among the solutions developed for this task, a deep learning convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) model leveraging spectral phase differences and magnitude ratios between microphone signals is a popular option. In this paper, we explore adding source-count information for multi-sources DOA estimation. The use of dual-task training with joint multi-sources DOA estimation and source counting is first considered. We then consider using the source count as an auxiliary feature in a standalone DOA estimation system, where the number of active sources (0, 1, or 2+) is integrated into the CRNN architecture through early, mid, and late fusion strategies. Experiments using real binaural recordings are performed. Results show that the dual-task training does not improve DOA estimation performance, although it benefits source-count prediction. However, a ground-truth (oracle) source count used as an auxiliary feature significantly enhances standalone DOA estimation performance, with late fusion yielding up to 14% higher average F1-scores over the baseline CRNN. This highlights the potential of using source-count estimation for robust DOA estimation in binaural hearing aids.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate that a GAN can effectively leverage both noisy mixtures and spatial information to extract and generate the target speaker's speech. By conditioning the GAN on intermediate features of a discriminative spatial filtering model in addition to DoA, we enable steerable target extraction with high spatial resolution of 5 degrees, outperforming state-of-the-art discriminative methods in perceptual quality-based objective metrics.</p></details> |  |

In such settings, the classical Bartlett beamformer is commonly used, as maximum likelihood estimation becomes impractical when the number of sources is unknown or large, and spectral methods based on the sample covariance are not applicable due to the lack of multiple snapshots. However, the accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally limited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for generating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot. Specifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a hypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the capabilities of a much wider array. At inference time, a heatmap can be produced by scanning an arbitrary set of angles.

In this work, we focus on spatial audio understanding with an emphasis on reasoning about moving sources. First, we introduce a spatial audio encoder that processes spatial audio to detect multiple overlapping events and estimate their spatial attributes, Direction of Arrival (DoA) and source distance, at the frame level. To generalize to unseen events, we incorporate an audio grounding model that aligns audio features with semantic audio class text embeddings via a cross-attention mechanism. Second, to answer complex queries about dynamic audio scenes involving moving sources, we condition a large language model (LLM) on structured spatial attributes extracted by our model. Finally, we introduce a spatial audio motion understanding and reasoning benchmark dataset and demonstrate our framework's performance against the baseline model.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Bayesian Beamforming for Imaging by Marginalizing the Speed of Sound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03824v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging methods based on array signal processing often require a fixed propagation speed of the medium, or speed of sound (SoS) for methods based on acoustic signals. The resolution of the images formed using these methods is strongly affected by the assumed SoS, which, due to multipath, nonlinear propagation, and non-uniform mediums, is challenging at best to select. In this letter, we propose a Bayesian approach to marginalize the influence of the SoS on beamformers for imaging. We adapt Bayesian direction-of-arrival estimation to an imaging setting and integrate a popular minimum variance beamformer over the posterior of the SoS. To solve the Bayesian integral efficiently, we use numerical Gauss quadrature. We apply our beamforming approach to shallow water sonar imaging where multipath and nonlinear propagation is abundant. We compare against the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and demonstrate that its Bayesian counterpart achieves improved range and azimuthal resolution while effectively suppressing multipath artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Sparse sensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields such as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems. They offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including reduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of mutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations, compute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status of arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators that focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and sidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this tool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective. Numerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and its potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could also be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract young minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 Figures, Currently Under Peer Review</p></details> |
| **[Tangential Velocity Estimation Using Near-Field Automotive Radar Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04692v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the problem of tangential velocity estimation in automotive radar systems, addressing the limitations of conventionally considered models. Conventional automotive radars are usually based on far-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential component of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for reliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we introduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration elements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space. Conventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood function for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is correctly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential velocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential velocity estimation using the Cramér-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The insights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration and the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based algorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity estimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition to tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood smearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the theoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both single- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various benchmark schemes.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Resilience of Direction-Shift Keying Against Phase Noise and Short Channel Coherence Time at mmWave Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01103v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid variation of the wireless channel (short channel coherence time) and the phase noise are two prominent concerns in Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-Terahertz systems communication systems. Equalizing the channel effect and tracking the phase noise necessitate dense pilot insertion. Direction-Shift Keying (DSK), a recent variant of Spatial Modulation (SM), addresses these challenges by encoding information in the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) using a distributed antenna system (DAS), rather than relying on amplitude or phase. DSK has been shown to extend coherence time by up to four orders of magnitude. Despite its promise, existing DSK studies are largely simulation-based and limited to simplified roadside unit scenarios and mobile device (MD) equipped with only two antennas. DSK's performance in general settings, along with the fundamental laws governing its behavior, such as coherence time and resilience to phase noise, remain open problems. In this paper, we derive the structure of the optimal detector for the case of $M$-antenna MD. Then, we establish the governing law for DSK's coherence time, termed the Direction Coherence Time (DCT), defining the the temporal duration over which the DoA remains approximately invariant. We analytically establish that DCT scales with $d/v$ (transmitter-receiver distance over velocity), while the Channel Coherence Time (CCT) scales with $λ/v$, revealing a coherence time gain on the order of $d/λ$ (equivalent to more than four orders of magnitude.) Furthermore, we prove that DSK inherently cancels the phase noise, requiring no additional compensation. Analytical predictions are validated through simulations, confirming the robustness and scalability of DSK in high-frequency mobile environments.</p></details> |  |

However, its use for learning spatial representations from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal processing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proc.

| **[Fourth-Order Hierarchical Array: A Novel Scheme for Sparse Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Difference Co-Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19522v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional array designs based on circular fourth-order cumulant typically adopt a single expression form of the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA), which limits the achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and neglects the impact of mutual coupling among physical sensors. To address above issues, this paper proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements. The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse linear arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spars...</summary><p>Sparse linear array, fourth-order cumulant, mutual coupling, redundancy, direction of arrival estimation</p></details> |
| **[Polarization-Aware DoA Detection Relying on a Single Rydberg Atomic Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17179v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A polarization-aware direction-of-arrival (DoA) detection scheme is conceived that leverages the intrinsic vector sensitivity of a single Rydberg atomic vapor cell to achieve quantum-enhanced angle resolution. Our core idea lies in the fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely determined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of which can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be specific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable quantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the same vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted from the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole transition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same experimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole resonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF magnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent sensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the need for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation, we derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization and orientation angles. Finally, simulation results spanning various quantum parameters validate the proposed approach and identify optimal operating regimes. With appropriately chosen polarization and magnetic-field geometries, a single vapor cell is expected to achieve sub-0.1$^\circ$ angle resolution at moderate RF-field driving strengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for publication, 13 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[The ECME Algorithm Using Factor Analysis for DOA Estimation in Nonuniform Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02223v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum likelihood factor analysis has been applied to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and a variety of iterative approaches have been developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this article, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and is computationally more efficient. Importantly, the signal subspace estimated by the ECME algorithm can be employed for the subspace based DOA estimation in unknown nonuniform noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[BeamSeek: Deep Learning-based DOA Estimation for Low-Complexity mmWave Phased Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13075v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach combining agile beam switching with deep learning to enhance the speed and accuracy of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array systems with low-complexity hardware implementations is proposed and evaluated. Traditional DOA methods requiring direct access to individual antenna elements are impractical for analog or hybrid beamforming systems prevalent in modern mmWave implementations. Recent agile beam switching techniques have demonstrated rapid DOA estimation, but their accuracy and robustness can be further improved via deep learning. BeamSeek addresses these limitations by employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and specialized data augmentation that emulates real-world propagation conditions. The proposed approach was experimentally validated at 60 GHz using the NSF PAWR COSMOS testbed, demonstrating significant improvements over a correlation-based method across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Results show that BeamSeek achieves up to an 8 degree reduction in average estimation error compared to this baseline, with particular advantages in noisy channels. This makes it especially suitable for practical mmWave deployments in environments characterized by multipath interference and hardware constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Furthermore, angular-based localization significantly reduces installation effort by minimizing the number of required fixed anchor nodes. In this contribution, we propose the so-called MASSLOC system, which leverages sparse two-dimensional array geometries to localize and identify a large number of concurrently active sources. Additionally, the use of complementary Zadoff-Chu sequences is introduced to enable efficient, beamforming-based source identification. These sequences provide a trade-off between favorable correlation properties and accurate, unsynchronized direction-of-arrival estimation by exhibiting a spectrally balanced waveform. The system is evaluated in both a controlled anechoic chamber and a highly reverberant lobby environment with a reverberation time of 1.6 s. In a laboratory setting, successful direction-of-arrival estimation and identification of up to 14 simultaneously emitting sources are demonstrated. Adopting a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) calibration approach, the system achieves a median three-dimensional localization error of 55.7 mm and a median angular error of 0.84 deg with dynamic source movement of up to 1.9 mps in the challenging reverberant environment. The multi-source capability is also demonstrated and evaluated in that environment with a total of three tags. These results indicate the scalability and robustness of the MASSLOC system, even under challenging acoustic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Scalable FAS: A New Paradigm for Array Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10831v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework, we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to different source types.</p></details> | 13 pages |

By ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the proposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric, closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Fluid Antenna Enabled Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Under Time-Constrained Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10820v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture, whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses. Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce computational complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</p></details> |  |

We focus on a two-step approach which first estimates the signal subspace via covariance estimation and then extracts DOA angles by the ESPRIT algorithm. In particular, we analyze two stochastic quantization schemes which use dithering: a one-bit quantizer combined with rectangular dither and a multi-bit quantizer with triangular dither. For each quantizer, we derive rigorous high probability bounds for the distances between the true and estimated signal subspaces and DOA angles. Using our analysis, we identify scenarios in which subspace and DOA estimation via triangular dithering qualitatively outperforms rectangular dithering. We verify in numerical simulations that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the target matrix. The resulting subspace estimation guarantees are equally applicable in the analysis of other spectral estimation algorithms and related problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direction of Arrival Estimation with Virtual Antenna Array Using FMCW Radar Simulated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07513v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The FMCW radars are widely used for automotive radar systems. The basic idea for FMCW radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency, (i.e., beat frequency) between the transmitted and received signal is determined after down conversion. The FFT operation on beat frequency signal can recognize targets at different range and velocity. Increasing demand on safety functionality leads to the Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation to resolve two closely located targets. Consequently, the problem of angle estimation for 77GHz FMCW automotive radar simulated data has been investigated in this term project. In particular, we examined the performances of FFT, MUSIC and compressed sensing in angle estimation task, and it was found that although FFT is the fastest algorithm, it has very poor angular resolution when compared with others which are both super resolution algorithms.

Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360° video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</p></details> |  |
| **[CRB-Rate Tradeoff for Bistatic ISAC with Gaussian Information and Deterministic Sensing Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21879v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS), a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive the corresponding Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | 13 pages,6 figures |

A signal coarse alignment strategy is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios. Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within 5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA) is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while maintaining a low computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to possible IEEE journal</p></details> |

Our approach efficiently captures spatial and temporal features, enabling robust performance in highly complex scenarios with multiple simultaneous speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model not only significantly enhances the target speech within the defined beamwidth but also effectively suppresses interference from other directions, producing a clear and isolated target voice.

| **[DOA Estimation via Optimal Weighted Low-Rank Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19996v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs from the restored uniform linear array samples. We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation. We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods. Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at low-noise conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Differential Evolution Algorithm with Neighbor-hood Mutation for DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06020v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time. This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA estimation in practical applications.

| **[GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system under spoofing and jamming attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, batteryless systems often suffer from missing data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting, degrading localization performance. We propose LOCUS, a deep learning framework that recovers corrupted features in such settings. LOCUS integrates three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo) to identify corrupted regions, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS) to reconstruct missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep) to restore data without altering valid inputs. LOCUS significantly improves DoA accuracy under missing-channel conditions, achieving up to 36.91% error reduction on DCASE and LargeSet, and 25.87-59.46% gains in real-world deployments. We release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support future research on localization under energy constraints.

| **[Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[RadioDiff-3D: A 3D$\times$3D Radio Map Dataset and Generative Diffusion Based Benchmark for 6G Environment-Aware Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12166v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/UrbanRadio3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with Onscreen/offscreen Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12042v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change shifts the focus from more specialized 360° audio and audiovisual scene analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data, the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane (left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric, which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs reasonably well with the stereo audio data.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

The device will accurately localize and identify sound sources in real time. This study will fill an important gap in current research by leveraging machine learning techniques to target the underprivileged community. The system includes three main components. 1. JerryNet: A custom designed CNN architecture that determines the direction of arrival (DoA) for nine possible directions. 2. Audio Classification: This model is based on fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to identify the exact sound classes only based on audio. 3. Multimodal integration model: This is an accurate sound localization model that combines audio, visual, and text data to locate the exact sound sources in the images. The part consists of two modules, one object detection using Yolov9 to generate all the bounding boxes of the objects, and an audio visual localization model to identify the optimal bounding box using complete Intersection over Union (CIoU). The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets, respectively. The audio-visual localization model within component 3 yielded a cIoU of 0.892 and an AUC of 0.658, surpassing other similar models. There are many future potentials to this study, paving the way to creating a new generation of accessibility devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end multi-channel speaker extraction and binaural speech synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05739v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech clarity and spatial audio immersion are the two most critical factors in enhancing remote conferencing experiences. Existing methods are often limited: either due to the lack of spatial information when using only one microphone, or because their performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation when using microphone array. To overcome this issue, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that has the capacity of mapping multi-channel noisy and reverberant signals to clean and spatialized binaural speech directly. This framework unifies source extraction, noise suppression, and binaural rendering into one network. In this framework, a novel magnitude-weighted interaural level difference loss function is proposed that aims to improve the accuracy of spatial rendering. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms established baselines in terms of both speech quality and spatial fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Acoustic Mapping for Direction of Arrival Estimation: A Self-Supervised Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07066v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic mapping techniques have long been used in spatial audio processing for direction of arrival estimation (DoAE). Traditional beamforming methods for acoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can be computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the other hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed and robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability. Despite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize across diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader applicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a self-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional methods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM generates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions, and operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its robustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves comparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods. Additionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features for supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its potential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-centric Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13394v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

| **[Matrix Pencil-Based DoA Estimation for Hybrid Receivers in Snapshot-Limited Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02132v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM). Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC) and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic, potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and comparisons with the Cramér-Rao lower bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review for potential publication in IEEE Journal</p></details> |

These systems, typically trained from scratch on specific datasets, have shown considerable generalization capabilities. Recently, deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable success in the sound event classification (SEC) field, prompting an open question of whether these advances can be extended to the development of SELD foundation models. In this paper, leveraging the power of pre-trained SEC models, we propose pre-trained SELD networks (PSELDNets) on a large-scale synthetic dataset. The synthetic dataset, generated by convolving sound events with simulated spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs), contains 1,167 hours of audio clips with an ontology of 170 sound classes. These PSELDNets are applied to various SELD scenarios. When we adapt PSELDNets to specific scenarios, particularly in cases of low-resource data, we introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning method, AdapterBit. PSELDNets are evaluated on synthetic-test-set using collected SRIRs from the TAU Spatial Room Impulse Response Database (TAU-SRIR DB) and achieve satisfactory performance. We also carried out experiments to validate the transferability of PSELDNets to three publicly available datasets and our own real-world recordings. The results demonstrate that PSELDNets surpass state-of-the-art systems across all publicly available datasets. Given the need for direction-of-arrival estimation, SELD generally relies on sufficient multi-channel audio clips. However, incorporating the AdapterBit, PSELDNets show more efficient adaptability to various scenarios using minimal multi-channel or even just monophonic audio clips, outperforming traditional fine-tuning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing.

However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

For such a structure, it is a challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network (MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $α$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $α$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($α$ $\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Sep 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |

Despite the development of numerous mature super-resolution algorithms, the inherent end-fire effect problem in fixed antenna arrays remains inadequately addressed. This work proposed a novel array architecture composed of fluid antennas. By exploiting the spatial reconfigurability of their positions to equivalently modulate the array steering vector and integrating it with the classical MUSIC algorithm, this approach achieved high-precision DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers outstanding estimation performance even in highly challenging end-fire regions.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted; Astronomy and Computing</p></details> |
| **[Moment-Matching Array Processing Technique for diffuse source estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15283v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in signal processing. Diffuse sources, whose power density cannot be represented with a single angular coordinate, are usually characterized based on prior assumptions, which associate the source angular density with a specific set of functions. However, these assumptions can lead to significant estimation biases when they are incorrect. This paper introduces the Moment-Matching Estimation Technique (MoMET), a low-complexity method for estimating the mean DOA, spread, and power of a narrow diffuse source without requiring prior knowledge on the source distribution. The unknown source density is characterized by its mean DOA and its first central moments, which are estimated through covariance matching techniques which fit the empirical covariance of the measurements to that modeled from the moments. The MoMET parameterization is robust to incorrect model assumptions, and numerically efficient. The asymptotic bias and covariance of the new estimator are derived and its performance is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive MIMO Radar Architecture for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensing in the D-Band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17110v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The D-band offering an untapped wide bandwidth is promising for high data rate communication and high-resolution wireless sensing. However, these potentials are hindered by the low performance and energy efficiency of the D-band circuits and systems. We present an adaptive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar architecture for energy-efficient wireless sensing in the D-band, leveraging a reconfigurable 2D array of radar transceiver front-ends, a scaling approach for the receiver (RX) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the transmitter (TX) output power ($P_{\rm TX}$) with target distance, and dynamic selection of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm. The reconfigurable radar array, providing an adaptive radar resolution, enhances the energy efficiency by reducing power consumption in the radar RF front-end and lowering the computational complexity in the radar back-end. The RX SNR and the TX output power are scaled with the distance as ${\rm SNR} \propto d^{-p}$ and $P_{\rm TX} \propto d^{4-p}$, where $0 < p < 4$, leading to more efficient resource allocation in varying target distance conditions. Additionally, DOA estimation results using MUSIC and MVDR algorithms indicate that the optimum algorithm, in terms of the accuracy and computational complexity, should be selected based on the number of radar array elements. Furthermore, we develop a hardware model for the MIMO radar RF front-end to evaluate the power consumption of the TX, RX, and local oscillator (LO) distribution network. It is shown that the power consumption of the LO distribution network, which can dominate the power consumption for a large MIMO radar, can be minimized through a distribution strategy for LO amplifiers employed for compensating passive losses. Performance of the adaptive MIMO radar is evaluated in the free-space and the through-wall indoor sensing scenarios in the D-band.</p></details> |  |

Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

To address this vulnerability, we propose Transformer-based Adversarial Defense for DOA estimation (T-ADD), a transformer-based defense method designed to counter adversarial attacks. To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Speculative GLRT-Backed Approach for Adversarial Resilience on Deep Learning-Based Array Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09893v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Decoders for Sensing Subspace Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05028v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse antenna array sensing of source/target via direction of arrival (DoA) estimation motivates design of the sensing framework in joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems for sixth generation (6G) communication systems. Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajamäki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted for presentation at the 59th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |

We compare sparse arrays and classical uniform linear arrays, harnessing EM simulation tools to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of both patch and Vivaldi antenna element including mutual coupling effects. We show that with sparse array configurations, the performance impacts are significant in terms of DoA estimation accuracy and operable SNR ranges. Specifically, in the scenarios considered, both the usage of directional antenna elements and a sparse array result in over 90% reduction in average direction finding error, compared to a uniform omnidirectional array with the same number of elements (in this case eight), when estimating the directions of two sources using the MUSIC algorithm. For a fixed angular RMSE, the improvements in array sensitivity are shown to yield a 4 to 15-fold increase in one-way coverage distance (assuming free-space path loss). Among the studied options, the best performance was obtained using sparse arrays with either patch or Vivaldi elements for field of views of 100$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this letter, we investigate the sensor position selection in a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing system. The IRS consists of passive elements and active sensors, where the sensors can receive and process the echo signal for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Motivated by the movable antenna array and fluid antenna system, we consider the case where the sensors are integrated into a group for movement and derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Then, the optimal solution for the positions of the movable sensors (MSs) to the CRB minimization problem is derived in closed form. Moreover, we characterize the relationship between the CRB and system parameters. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MS scheme over the fixed-position (FP) scheme.</p></details> |  |

We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the random angular location parameters of a point target, whose prior distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to investigate the potential of leveraging prior information from two distinct perspectives, thereby providing deeper insights into the estimation process, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar transmit beampattern design problems and propose corresponding low complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a practical, low-latency and resource-aware technique for sensing the entire field-of-view (FOV) and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in such settings by leveraging time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing. This results in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better DoA estimation reliability.

We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.</p></details> |  |

Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |

Most existing DOA models are trained on synthetic data by convolving clean speech with room impulse responses (RIRs), which limits their generalizability due to constrained acoustic diversity. In this paper, we revisit DOA estimation using a recently introduced dataset constructed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), which provides more realistic and diverse spatial audio scenes. We benchmark several representative neural-based DOA methods on this dataset and propose LightDOA, a lightweight DOA estimation model based on depthwise separable convolutions, specifically designed for mutil-channel input in varying environments. Experimental results show that LightDOA achieves satisfactory accuracy and robustness across various acoustic scenes while maintaining low computational complexity. This study not only highlights the potential of spatial audio synthesized with the assistance of LLMs in advancing robust and efficient DOA estimation research, but also highlights LightDOA as efficient solution for resource-constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown strong performance in such conditions, they typically lack a mechanism to assess the reliability of their predictions - an essential feature for real-world deployment. In this work, we present the SRP-PHAT-NET, a deep neural network framework that leverages SRP-PHAT directional maps as spatial features and introduces a built-in reliability estimation. To enable meaningful reliability scoring, the model is trained using Gaussian-weighted labels centered around the true direction. We systematically analyze the influence of label smoothing on accuracy and reliability, demonstrating that the choice of Gaussian kernel width can be tuned to application-specific requirements.

Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing for publication</p></details> |

Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods (e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD) incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression (SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in two-dimensional large aperture arrays.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and ``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 5 pages.

For a three-dimensional scenario, SRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for position estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for multi-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed multi-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable, representing the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs to be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and set of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated absolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each source. The proposed multi-source DOA estimation method entirely eliminates the need for continuous variable optimization by defining a relative coordinate system per source such that one of its coordinate axes is aligned with the respective source DOA. The optimal set of candidate TDOA estimates is determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of a rank-reduced Gram matrix. The computational cost of the proposed EDM-based methods is significantly reduced compared to the SRP-based methods. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations show that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the SRP-based method in terms of two-source position and DOA estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (awaiting review)</p></details> |

By employing electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</p></details> |  |

Conventional gridless methods often fail in this scenario due to prohibitive computational costs or a lack of robustness. We propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by jointly estimating a manifold transformation matrix and the source azimuth-elevation pairs within a single, unified optimization problem. This problem is solved efficiently using an inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (iALM), which completely circumvents the need for semidefinite programming. By unifying the objectives of data fidelity and transformation robustness, our approach is uniquely suited for the demanding single-snapshot case. Simulation results confirm that the proposed iALM framework provides robust and high-resolution, gridless 2D-DOA estimates, establishing its efficacy for challenging array signal processing applications.</p></details> |  |

Among the solutions developed for this task, a deep learning convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) model leveraging spectral phase differences and magnitude ratios between microphone signals is a popular option. In this paper, we explore adding source-count information for multi-sources DOA estimation. The use of dual-task training with joint multi-sources DOA estimation and source counting is first considered. We then consider using the source count as an auxiliary feature in a standalone DOA estimation system, where the number of active sources (0, 1, or 2+) is integrated into the CRNN architecture through early, mid, and late fusion strategies. Experiments using real binaural recordings are performed. Results show that the dual-task training does not improve DOA estimation performance, although it benefits source-count prediction. However, a ground-truth (oracle) source count used as an auxiliary feature significantly enhances standalone DOA estimation performance, with late fusion yielding up to 14% higher average F1-scores over the baseline CRNN. This highlights the potential of using source-count estimation for robust DOA estimation in binaural hearing aids.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In such settings, the classical Bartlett beamformer is commonly used, as maximum likelihood estimation becomes impractical when the number of sources is unknown or large, and spectral methods based on the sample covariance are not applicable due to the lack of multiple snapshots. However, the accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally limited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for generating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot. Specifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a hypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the capabilities of a much wider array. At inference time, a heatmap can be produced by scanning an arbitrary set of angles.

Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various benchmark schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, its use for learning spatial representations from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal processing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proc.

To address above issues, this paper proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements. The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse linear arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spars...</summary><p>Sparse linear array, fourth-order cumulant, mutual coupling, redundancy, direction of arrival estimation</p></details> |

In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this article, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and is computationally more efficient. Importantly, the signal subspace estimated by the ECME algorithm can be employed for the subspace based DOA estimation in unknown nonuniform noise.</p></details> |  |

Traditional DOA methods requiring direct access to individual antenna elements are impractical for analog or hybrid beamforming systems prevalent in modern mmWave implementations. Recent agile beam switching techniques have demonstrated rapid DOA estimation, but their accuracy and robustness can be further improved via deep learning. BeamSeek addresses these limitations by employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and specialized data augmentation that emulates real-world propagation conditions. The proposed approach was experimentally validated at 60 GHz using the NSF PAWR COSMOS testbed, demonstrating significant improvements over a correlation-based method across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Results show that BeamSeek achieves up to an 8 degree reduction in average estimation error compared to this baseline, with particular advantages in noisy channels. This makes it especially suitable for practical mmWave deployments in environments characterized by multipath interference and hardware constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Scalable FAS: A New Paradigm for Array Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10831v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework, we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to different source types.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[The Future is Fluid: Revolutionizing DOA Estimation with Sparse Fluid Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10826v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a design framework for sparse fluid antenna systems (FAS) enabling high-performance direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, particularly in challenging millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments. By ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the proposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric, closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Fluid Antenna Enabled Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Under Time-Constrained Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10820v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture, whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses. Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce computational complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23883v6)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace and DOA estimation under coarse quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17037v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation from coarsely quantized data. We focus on a two-step approach which first estimates the signal subspace via covariance estimation and then extracts DOA angles by the ESPRIT algorithm. In particular, we analyze two stochastic quantization schemes which use dithering: a one-bit quantizer combined with rectangular dither and a multi-bit quantizer with triangular dither. For each quantizer, we derive rigorous high probability bounds for the distances between the true and estimated signal subspaces and DOA angles. Using our analysis, we identify scenarios in which subspace and DOA estimation via triangular dithering qualitatively outperforms rectangular dithering. We verify in numerical simulations that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the target matrix. The resulting subspace estimation guarantees are equally applicable in the analysis of other spectral estimation algorithms and related problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direction of Arrival Estimation with Virtual Antenna Array Using FMCW Radar Simulated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07513v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The FMCW radars are widely used for automotive radar systems. The basic idea for FMCW radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency, (i.e., beat frequency) between the transmitted and received signal is determined after down conversion. The FFT operation on beat frequency signal can recognize targets at different range and velocity. Increasing demand on safety functionality leads to the Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation to resolve two closely located targets. Consequently, the problem of angle estimation for 77GHz FMCW automotive radar simulated data has been investigated in this term project. In particular, we examined the performances of FFT, MUSIC and compressed sensing in angle estimation task, and it was found that although FFT is the fastest algorithm, it has very poor angular resolution when compared with others which are both super resolution algorithms.

| **[AV-SSAN: Audio-Visual Selective DoA Estimation through Explicit Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07384v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual sound source localization (AV-SSL) estimates the position of sound sources by fusing auditory and visual cues. Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Beamformed 360° Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00307v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a U-net model for 360° acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360° video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</p></details> |  |
| **[CRB-Rate Tradeoff for Bistatic ISAC with Gaussian Information and Deterministic Sensing Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21879v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS), a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive the corresponding Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | 13 pages,6 figures |
| **[DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA) is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while maintaining a low computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to possible IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[DOA Estimation via Optimal Weighted Low-Rank Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19996v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs from the restored uniform linear array samples. We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation. We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods. Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at low-noise conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Differential Evolution Algorithm with Neighbor-hood Mutation for DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06020v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time.

However, batteryless systems often suffer from missing data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting, degrading localization performance. We propose LOCUS, a deep learning framework that recovers corrupted features in such settings. LOCUS integrates three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo) to identify corrupted regions, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS) to reconstruct missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep) to restore data without altering valid inputs. LOCUS significantly improves DoA accuracy under missing-channel conditions, achieving up to 36.91% error reduction on DCASE and LargeSet, and 25.87-59.46% gains in real-world deployments. We release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support future research on localization under energy constraints.

| **[Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with Onscreen/offscreen Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12042v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change shifts the focus from more specialized 360° audio and audiovisual scene analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data, the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane (left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric, which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs reasonably well with the stereo audio data.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-centric Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13394v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

| **[Matrix Pencil-Based DoA Estimation for Hybrid Receivers in Snapshot-Limited Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02132v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM). Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC) and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic, potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and comparisons with the Cramér-Rao lower bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review for potential publication in IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[Sensing for Free: Learn to Localize More Sources than Antennas without Pilots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23525v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the radiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike conventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field localization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and range information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its extensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field localization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions, including non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number of snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided subspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to real-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep learning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix to improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded AI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce computational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training method to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with casting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classical and existing deep-learning-based localization techniques, providing robust near-field localization even under coherent sources, miscalibrations, and few snapshots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication in the IEEE</p></details> |

We aim to provide a mathematical foundation for sparsity-based super-resolution in such spectral estimation problems in both one- and multi-dimensional spaces. In particular, we estimate the resolution and stability of the location recovery when considering the sparsest solution under the measurement constraint, and characterize their dependence on the cut-off frequency, the noise level, the sparsity of point sources, and the incoherence of the amplitude vectors of point sources. Our estimate emphasizes the importance of the high incoherence of amplitude vectors in enhancing the resolution of multi-snapshot spectral estimation. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it also provides the first stability result in the super-resolution regime for the well-known sparse MMV problem in DOA estimation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 0 figure |

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MUSIC algorithm from a finite-precision arithmetic perspective. First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the classic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating this computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision method is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method partitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block computations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use high-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we develop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and multiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed finite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more than 50\% computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Sensing and Communication System Based on Radio Frequency Resonance Beam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18878v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the complex beam control in traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, researchers have proposed adaptive beam alignment using retro-directive antenna (RDA) arrays. This approach creates echo resonance between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), significantly reducing computational load. However, conventional resonant beam systems (RBS) suffer from echo interference due to the shared uplink and downlink frequency. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative resonance beam-based integrated sensing and communication (RB-ISAC) system designed for efficient passive sensing and bidirectional communication. In this system, the UE operates passively, with both the BS and UE utilizing a phase conjugation and frequency conversion structure to decouple uplink and downlink carrier frequencies, ensuring continuous electromagnetic wave oscillation between the two ends. Effective compensation for signal propagation loss enables resonance after multiple oscillations. At this point, the beam's field forms a low-diffraction-loss, highly focused pattern, automatically aligning the transmitter and receiver. This enables high-precision passive positioning alongside robust uplink and downlink communication. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system achieves resonance within multiple iterations, supporting uplink and downlink communication up to 5 m, and enabling passive direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with an error under 2$^\circ$ .</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel neural network-based architecture to address this challenge. The key innovation is the introduction of a dedicated, learnable IRS layer integrated within a carefully designed end-to-end system established upon the physical and geometrical basis of the problem. Unlike conventional neural network layers, this specific one incorporates block diagonal sinusoidal weight constraints, where the phase arguments of these sinusoids are learned during training to directly emulate the phase shifts of the IRS elements. This allows the end-to-end system to optimize the IRS configuration for enhanced DoA estimation, eliminating the need for separate IRS optimization algorithms. Moreover, different DoA regression networks, including a proposed structure, are presented and examined. Numerical simulations, conducted under various conditions and noise levels, where controlled coherent multi-path components are introduced due to the presence of the IRS, demonstrate the superior performance of the novel end-to-end system compared to others and highlight its potential to significantly improve the accuracy of DoA estimation in complex IRS-assisted wireless systems. Besides, corresponding computational complexities of different approaches are also compared.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Sparse Sum and Difference Co-Array With Low Redundancy and Enhanced DOF for Non-Circular Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16675v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Array structures based on the sum and difference co-arrays provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of sum and difference co-arrays, the paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of second-order cumulants. We present a mathematical framework based on second-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and define the redundancy of SO-ECA. Based on SO-ECA, a novel array is proposed, namely low redundancy sum and difference array (LR-SDA), which can provide closed-form expressions for the sensor positions and enhance DOF in order to resolve more signal sources in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of non-circular (NC) signals. For LR-SDA, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors can be derived and the SO-ECA of LR-SDA is hole-free. Further, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of signal reconstruction for LR-SDA are derived. Additionally, the redundancy and weight function of LR-SDA are defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for LR-SDA is derived. The proposed LR-SDA achieves higher DOF and lower redundancy than those of existing DCAs designed based on sum and difference co-arrays. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of LR-SDA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |

For effective classification and localization, a channel-spectro-temporal transformer (CST-former) was suggested. CST-former employs multidimensional attention mechanisms across the spatial, spectral, and temporal domains to enlarge the model's capacity to learn the domain information essential for event detection and DoA estimation over time. In this work, we present an enhanced version of CST-former with multiscale unfolded local embedding (MSULE) developed to capture and aggregate domain information over multiple time-frequency scales. Also, we propose finetuning and post-processing techniques beneficial for conducting the SELD task over limited training datasets. In-depth ablation studies of the proposed architecture and detailed analysis on the proposed modules are carried out to validate the efficacy of multidimensional attentions on the SELD task. Empirical validation through experimentation on STARSS22 and STARSS23 datasets demonstrates the remarkable performance of CST-former and post-processing techniques without using external data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> |

Recently, near-field (NF) emitter localization including direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimations has drawn a lot of attention, but is rarely explored via PC-HAD structure. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of PC-HAD structure on the NF emitter localization and observe that the phase ambiguity (PA) problem caused by PC-HAD structure can be removed inherently with low-latency in the NF scenario. To obtain the exact NF DOA estimation results, we propose a grouped PC-HAD structure, which is capable of dividing the NF DOA estimation problem into multiple FF DOA estimation problems via partitioning the large-scale PC-HAD array into small-scale groups. An angle calibration method is developed to address the inconsistency among these FF DOA estimation problems. Then, to eliminate PA and improve the NF emitter localization performance, we develop three machine learning (ML)-based methods, i.e., two low-complexity data-driven clustering-based methods and one model-driven regression method, namely RegNet. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of NF emitter localization for the proposed grouped PC-HAD structure is derived and reveals that localization performance will decrease with the increasing of the number of groups. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve CRLB at different SNR regions, the RegNet has great performance advantages at low SNR regions and the clustering-based methods have much lower computation complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Selection via MCRB Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04136v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many estimation theory and statistical analysis problems, the true data model is unknown, or partially unknown. To describe the model generating the data, parameterized models of some degree are used. A question that arises is which model should be used to best approximate the true model, a.k.a. model selection. In the field of machine learning, it is encountered in the form of architecture types of neural networks, number of model parameters, etc. In this paper, we propose a new model selection criterion, based on the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for mean-squared-error (MSE) performance. The criterion selects the model in which the bound on the estimated parameters MSE is the lowest, compared to other candidate models. Its goal is to minimize the MSE with-respect-to (w.r.t.) the model. The criterion is applied to the problems of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation under unknown clutter / interference, and spectrum estimation of auto-regressive (AR) model. It is shown to incorporate the bias-variance trade-off, and outperform the Akaike information criterion (AIC), finite-sample corrected AIC (AICc), and minimum description length (MDL) in terms of MSE performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Design Method for Seeking Sparse Linear Arrays With Low Redundancy and Enhanced DOF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17758v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse arrays with $N$-sensors can provide up to $O(N^2)$ degrees of freedom (DOF) by second-order cumulants. However, these sparse arrays like minimum-/low-redundancy arrays (MRAs/LRAs), nested arrays and coprime arrays can only provide limited DOF and array aperture with the same number of physical sensors. However, further increasing DOF would increase costs in practical applications. The paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF and lower redundancy via exploring different cases of third-order cumulants. Based on the framework third-order exhaustive co-array (TO-ECA), a general third-order array (GTOA) with any generator is proposed in the paper. Further, three novel arrays are designed based on GTOA with different generators, namely third-order sum and difference array (generator) (TO-SDA(CNA)), (TO-SDA(SCNA)) and (TO-SDA(TNA-II)) which can provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF in order to resolve more signal sources in the estimation of direction of arrival (DOA). The three TO-SDAs are all consisted of two sub-arrays, where the first is the generator and another is a ULA with big inter-spacing between sensors. For the three TO-SDAs, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors can be derived and the TO-ECA of the three TO-SDAs are hole-free. Additionally, the redundancy of the three TO-SDAs is defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for the three TO-SDAs is derived. Furthermore, the proposed TO-SDA(TNA-II) not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing TONA and even SE-FL-NA but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Meanwhile it realizes higher resolution and decreases redundancy. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of TO-SDA(TNA-II) on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 27 figures |

This paper proposes a dynamic array partitioning framework for monostatic ISAC systems to fully exploit available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and reconfigurable antenna topologies, enhancing sensing performance in complex scenarios. We first establish a theoretical foundation for our work by deriving Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds (BCRBs) under prior distribution constraints for heterogeneous target models, encompassing both point-like and extended targets. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization framework for transmit beamforming and dynamic array partitioning to minimize the derived BCRBs for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The optimization problem incorporates practical constraints, including multi-user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements, transmit power budgets, and array partitioning feasibility conditions. To address the non-convexity of the problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). We also design novel maximum a posteriori (MAP) DOA estimation algorithms specifically adapted to the statistical characteristics of each target model. Extensive simulations illustrate the superiority of the proposed dynamic partitioning strategy over conventional fixed-array architectures across diverse system configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to IEEE journal</p></details> |

Many semidefinite programming (SDP)-based methods fall under this category. Although deep learning-based approaches enable the construction of more sophisticated objective functions, most methods still rely on covariance matrix reconstruction. In this paper, we propose new loss functions that are invariant to the scaling of the matrices and provide a comparative study of losses with varying degrees of invariance. The proposed loss functions are formulated based on the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio between the target matrix and the Gram matrix of the prediction. Numerical results show that a scale-invariant loss outperforms its non-invariant counterpart but is inferior to the recently proposed subspace loss that is invariant to the change of basis. These results provide evidence that designing loss functions with greater degrees of invariance is advantageous in deep learning-based gridless DoA estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages.

Concurrently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer additional controllable propagation paths, further amplifying interest in their application. However, previous studies have encountered substantial computational challenges due to the complexity of jointly designing SLP-based waveforms and RIS passive beamforming.

However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |

In an effort to achieve an improved performance trade-off between multiuser communications and radar sensing, this paper considers a dynamically-partitioned antenna array architecture for monostatic ISAC systems, in which each element of the array at the base station can function as either a transmit or receive antenna. To fully exploit the available spatial degrees of freedom for both communication and sensing functions, we jointly design the partitioning of the array between transmit and receive antennas together with the transmit beamforming in order to minimize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation error, while satisfying constraints on the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the transmit power budget. An alternating algorithm based on Dinkelbach's transform, the alternative direction method of multipliers, and majorization-minimization is developed to solve the resulting complicated optimization problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we also present a heuristic three-step strategy that optimizes the transmit beamforming after determining the antenna partitioning.

In particular, we consider an RIS-assisted ISAC system in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) simultaneously performs multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) communications and radar sensing with the assistance of an RIS. We focus on both target detection and parameter estimation performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), respectively. Two optimization problems are formulated for maximizing the achievable sum-rate of the multi-user communications under an SNR constraint for target detection or a CRB constraint for parameter estimation, the transmit power budget, and the unit-modulus constraint of the RIS reflection coefficients. Efficient algorithms are developed to solve these two complicated non-convex problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed joint beamforming and reflection designs compared with other schemes. In addition, it is shown that more RIS reflection elements bring larger performance gains for direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation than for target detection.</p></details> | accepted by IEEE TWC |

Resonant beam systems are considered promising IoT technologies with advantages such as beam self-alignment and energy concentration. To establish a resonant system in the radio frequency (RF) band and achieve multi-target localization, this paper designs a multi-target resonant system architecture, allowing a single base station (BS) to independently connect with multiple MTs. By employing a retro-directive array, a multi-channel cyclic model is established to realize one-to-many electromagnetic wave propagation and MT direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation through echo resonance. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports resonant establishment between the BS and multiple MTs. This helps the BS to still have high DOA estimation accuracy in the face of multiple passive MTs, and can ensure that the DOA error is less than 1 degree within a range of 6 meters at a 50degree field of view, with higher accuracy than active beamforming localization systems.</p></details> |  |

A two-channel software-defined radio (SDR) with time-division multiplexing (TDM) enables pseudo-coherent sampling of an eight-element uniform circular array (UCA) with low hardware complexity. A central reference antenna mitigates phase jitter and sampling errors. The system applies an enhanced MUSIC algorithm with spatial smoothing to handle light multipath interference in indoor and outdoor environments. Experiments in an anechoic chamber validate accuracy under ideal conditions, while real-world tests confirm robust performance in multipath-prone scenarios. With 5 Hz DoA updates and post-processing to enhance tracking, the system provides an accessible and reliable solution for DoA estimation in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 8 figures, IEEE IMS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Model Mismatch on DOA Estimation with MUSIC: Near-Field and Far-Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05016v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been substantial work on developing variants of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms that take advantage of the information present in the near-field propagation regime. However, it is not always easy to determine the correct propagation regime, which opens the possibility of incorrectly applying simpler algorithms (meant for far-field) in the near-field regime. Inspired by this, we use simulation results to investigate the performance drop when there is a mismatch between the signal model in the MUSIC algorithm and the propagation regime. For direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, we consider the cases when the receiver is in the near-field region but uses i) the near-field model, ii) the approximate near-field model (ANM) model, and iii) the far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. We also consider the case when the receiver is in the far-field region, and we use the correct far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. One contribution is that in the near-field, we have quantified the loss in performance when the ANM and the far-field model are used to create the beamforming matrix for the MUSIC algorithm, causing a reduction in estimation accuracy compared to the case when the correct near-field model is used to design the beamforming matrix. Another result is that in the near-field, when we incorrectly assume that the receiver is in the far-field and subsequently use the far-field beamforming matrix, we underestimate the DOA estimation error. Finally, we show that the MUSIC algorithm can provide very accurate range estimates for distances less than the Fraunhofer distance. This estimate gradually becomes inaccurate as the distances exceed the Fraunhofer distance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Dynamic Subarray Architecture for Efficient DOA Estimation in THz Ultra-Massive Hybrid MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18378v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terahertz (THz) communication combined with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technology is promising for 6G wireless systems, where fast and precise direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is crucial for effective beamforming. However, finding DOAs in THz UM-MIMO systems faces significant challenges: while reducing hardware complexity, the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture introduces inherent difficulties in spatial information acquisition the large-scale antenna array causes significant deviations in eigenvalue decomposition results; and conventional two-dimensional DOA estimation methods incur prohibitively high computational overhead, hindering fast and accurate realization. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid dynamic subarray (HDS) architecture that strategically divides antenna elements into subarrays, ensuring phase differences between subarrays correlate exclusively with single-dimensional DOAs. Leveraging this architectural innovation, we develop two efficient algorithms for DOA estimation: a reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) algorithm that enables fast processing by correcting large-scale array estimation bias, and an improved version that further accelerates estimation by exploiting THz channel sparsity to obtain initial closed-form solutions through specialized two-RF-chain configuration. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework through Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis, providing fundamental insights for different HDS configurations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution achieves both superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for practical THz UM-MIMO systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Partial Calibration to Full Potential: A Two-Stage Sparse DOA Estimation for Incoherently-Distributed Sources with Gain-Phase Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16854v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for incoherently distributed (ID) sources is essential in multipath wireless communication scenarios, yet it remains challenging due to the combined effects of angular spread and gain-phase uncertainties in antenna arrays. This paper presents a two-stage sparse DOA estimation framework, transitioning from partial calibration to full potential, under the generalized array manifold (GAM) framework. In the first stage, coarse DOA estimates are obtained by exploiting the output from a subset of partly-calibrated arrays (PCAs). In the second stage, these estimates are utilized to determine and compensate for gain-phase uncertainties across all array elements. Then a sparse total least-squares optimization problem is formulated and solved via alternating descent to refine the DOA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method attained improved estimation accuracy compared to existing approaches, while maintaining robustness against both noise and angular spread effects in practical multipath environments.</p></details> |  |

Unlike uniform sensor spacing arrangement, where sensors are equidistant (equal to half the wavelength), we consider non-uniform spacing for the arrangement of sensors, where the distance between consecutive sensors increases progressively.

Further the propagator spatial spectrum is reused after performing the polynomial rooting to alleviate the observed drawback of an increase in RMSE at lower SNRs for estimating the directions-of-arrival of signals impinging on a linear array of sensors. Our proposed algorithm achieves a 98% reduction in computational complexity compared to Propagator alongside an improved angular resolution suitable for real time DOA estimation for wireless communications.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[An Experimental Study on Joint Modeling for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Source Distance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10755v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional sound event localization and detection (SELD) tasks, the focus is typically on sound event detection (SED) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, but they fall short of providing full spatial information about the sound source. The 3D SELD task addresses this limitation by integrating source distance estimation (SDE), allowing for complete spatial localization. We propose three approaches to tackle this challenge: a novel method with independent training and joint prediction, which firstly treats DOA and distance estimation as separate tasks and then combines them to solve 3D SELD; a dual-branch representation with source Cartesian coordinate used for simultaneous DOA and distance estimation; and a three-branch structure that jointly models SED, DOA, and SDE within a unified framework. Our proposed method ranked first in the DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint modeling for addressing the 3D SELD task. The relevant code for this paper will be open-sourced in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |
| **[Completing Sets of Prototype Transfer Functions for Subspace-based Direction of Arrival Estimation of Multiple Speakers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07524v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of multiple speakers, subspace-based prototype transfer function matching methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) or relative transfer function (RTF) vector matching are commonly employed. In general, these methods require calibrated microphone arrays, which are characterized by a known array geometry or a set of known prototype transfer functions for several directions. In this paper, we consider a partially calibrated microphone array, composed of a calibrated binaural hearing aid and a (non-calibrated) external microphone at an unknown location with no available set of prototype transfer functions. We propose a procedure for completing sets of prototype transfer functions by exploiting the orthogonality of subspaces, allowing to apply matching-based DOA estimation methods with partially calibrated microphone arrays. For the MUSIC and RTF vector matching methods, experimental results for two speakers in noisy and reverberant environments clearly demonstrate that for all locations of the external microphone DOAs can be estimated more accurately with completed sets of prototype transfer functions than with incomplete sets. \c{opyright}20XX IEEE.

| **[DNN-based Enhanced DOA Sensing via Massive MIMO Receiver with Switches-based Hybrid Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14297v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Switches-based hybrid architecture has attracted much attention, especially in directional-of-arrival (DOA) sensing, due to its ability of significantly reducing the hardware cost by compressing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays with switching networks. However, this structure will lead to a degradation in the degrees of freedom (DOF) and accuracy of DOA estimation. To address these two issues, we first propose a switches-based sparse hybrid array (SW-SHA). In this method, we design a dynamic switching network to form a synthesized sparse array, i.e., SW-SHA, that can enlarge the virtual aperture obtained by the difference co-array, thereby significantly enhancing the DOF. Second, in order to improve the DOA estimation accuracy of switches-based hybrid arrays, a deep neural network (DNN)-based method called ASN-DNN is proposed. It includes an antenna selection network (ASN) for optimizing the switch connections based on the criterion of minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the peak sidelobe level (PSL) constraint and a DNN for DOA estimation. Then by integrating ASN and DNN into an iterative process, the ASN-DNN is obtained. Furthermore, the closed-form expression of CRLB for DOA estimation is derived to evaluate the performance lower bound of switches-based hybrid arrays and provide a benchmark for ASN-DNN. The simulation results show the proposed ASN-DNN can achieve a greater performance than traditional methods, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Single-Snapshot DOA Estimation with Siamese Neural Networks for Sparse Linear Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07008v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-snapshot signal processing in sparse linear arrays has become increasingly vital, particularly in dynamic environments like automotive radar systems, where only limited snapshots are available. These arrays are often utilized either to cut manufacturing costs or result from unintended antenna failures, leading to challenges such as high sidelobe levels and compromised accuracy in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Despite deep learning's success in tasks such as DOA estimation, the need for extensive training data to increase target numbers or improve angular resolution poses significant challenges. In response, this paper presents a novel Siamese neural network (SNN) featuring a sparse augmentation layer, which enhances signal feature embedding and DOA estimation accuracy in sparse arrays. We demonstrate the enhanced DOA estimation performance of our approach through detailed feature analysis and performance evaluation.

| **[A Large-dimensional Analysis of ESPRIT DoA Estimation: Inconsistency and a Correction via RMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02746v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we perform asymptotic analyses of the widely used ESPRIT direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimator for large arrays, where the array size $N$ and the number of snapshots $T$ grow to infinity at the same pace. In this large-dimensional regime, the sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to be a poor eigenspectral estimator of the population covariance. We show that the classical ESPRIT algorithm, that relies on the SCM, and as a consequence of the large-dimensional inconsistency of the SCM, produces inconsistent DoA estimates as $N,T \to \infty$ with $N/T \to c \in (0,\infty)$, for both widely- and closely-spaced DoAs. Leveraging tools from random matrix theory (RMT), we propose an improved G-ESPRIT method and prove its consistency in the same large-dimensional setting. From a technical perspective, we derive a novel bound on the eigenvalue differences between two potentially non-Hermitian random matrices, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures.

| **[FOGNA: An effective Sum-Difference Co-Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Cumulants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18122v3)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA) provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array (FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order generalized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve more signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is consisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array and the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors. When the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in each subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the maximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form expressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing FODCAs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 29 figures |
| **[Robust Target Speaker Direction of Arrival Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18913v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-speaker environments the direction of arrival (DOA) of a target speaker is key for improving speech clarity and extracting target speaker's voice. However, traditional DOA estimation methods often struggle in the presence of noise, reverberation, and particularly when competing speakers are present. To address these challenges, we propose RTS-DOA, a robust real-time DOA estimation system. This system innovatively uses the registered speech of the target speaker as a reference and leverages full-band and sub-band spectral information from a microphone array to estimate the DOA of the target speaker's voice. Specifically, the system comprises a speech enhancement module for initially improving speech quality, a spatial module for learning spatial information, and a speaker module for extracting voiceprint features. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our RTS-DOA system effectively tackles multi-speaker scenarios and established new optimal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGSFusion: Radar-Camera Fusion with Hybrid Generation and Synchronization for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11489v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter-wave radar plays a vital role in 3D object detection for autonomous driving due to its all-weather and all-lighting-condition capabilities for perception. However, radar point clouds suffer from pronounced sparsity and unavoidable angle estimation errors. To address these limitations, incorporating a camera may partially help mitigate the shortcomings. Nevertheless, the direct fusion of radar and camera data can lead to negative or even opposite effects due to the lack of depth information in images and low-quality image features under adverse lighting conditions. Hence, in this paper, we present the radar-camera fusion network with Hybrid Generation and Synchronization (HGSFusion), designed to better fuse radar potentials and image features for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose the Radar Hybrid Generation Module (RHGM), which fully considers the Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimation errors in radar signal processing. This module generates denser radar points through different Probability Density Functions (PDFs) with the assistance of semantic information. Meanwhile, we introduce the Dual Sync Module (DSM), comprising spatial sync and modality sync, to enhance image features with radar positional information and facilitate the fusion of distinct characteristics in different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets by $6.53\%$ and $2.03\%$ in RoI AP and BEV AP, respectively.

Firstly, we formulate the off-grid DOA estimation model, utilizing the first-order off-grid approximation, incorporating one-bit data quantization. Subsequently, we address this problem using the Sparse Bayesian based framework and solve iteratively. However, traditional Sparse Bayesian methods often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To balance estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose a novel Learning-based Sparse Bayesian framework, which leverages an unrolled neural network architecture. This framework autonomously learns hyperparameters through supervised learning, offering more accurate off-grid DOA estimates and improved computational efficiency compared to some state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applicable to both uniform linear arrays and non-uniform sparse arrays.

| **[Fully Bayesian Wideband Direction-of-Arrival Estimation and Detection via RJMCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08895v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fully Bayesian approach to wideband, or broadband, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and signal detection. Unlike previous works in wideband DoA estimation and detection, where the signals were modeled in the time-frequency domain, we directly model the time-domain representation and treat the non-causal part of the source signal as latent variables. Furthermore, our Bayesian model allows for closed-form marginalization of the latent source signals by leveraging conjugacy. To further speed up computation, we exploit the sparse ``stripe matrix structure'' of the considered system, which stems from the circulant matrix representation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This drastically reduces the time complexity of computing the likelihood from $\mathcal{O}(N^3 k^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N k^3)$, where $N$ is the number of samples received by the array and $k$ is the number of sources. These computational improvements allow for efficient posterior inference through reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). We use the non-reversible extension of RJMCMC (NRJMCMC), which often achieves lower autocorrelation and faster convergence than the conventional reversible variant. Detection, estimation, and reconstruction of the latent source signals can then all be performed in a fully Bayesian manner through the samples drawn using NRJMCMC. We evaluate the detection performance of the procedure by comparing against generalized likelihood ratio testing (GLRT) and information criteria.</p></details> |  |

First, for achieving better DOA estimation performance at low SNRs while using non-stationary signals compared to the conventional frequency-difference (FD) paradigms, we propose parameterized time-frequency transform-based FD processing. Then, the unambiguous compressive FD beamforming is conceived to compensate the resolution loss induced by difference operation. Finally, we further derive a coarse-to-fine histogram statistics scheme to alleviate the perturbation in compressive FD beamforming with good DOA estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm regarding robustness, resolution, and DOA estimation accuracy.</p></details> | 6 figures |
| **[Wideband Modal Orthogonality: A New Approach for Broadband DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07261v1)** | 2020-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation techniques for sensors array have been studied extensively in the literature. Nevertheless, needing prior information on the number and directions of sources or demanding heavy computational load makes most of these techniques less useful in practice. In this paper, a low complexity subspace-based framework for DOA estimation of broadband signals, named as wideband modal orthogonality (WIMO), is proposed and accordingly two DOA estimators are developed. First, a closed-form approximation of spatial-temporal covariance matrix (STCM) in the uniform spectrum case is presented. The eigenvectors of STCM associated with non-zero eigenvalues are modal components of the wideband source in a given bandwidth and direction. WIMO idea is to extract these eigenvectors at desired DOAs from the approximated STCM and test their orthogonality to estimated noise subspace. In the non-uniform spectrum case, WIMO idea can be applied by approximating STCM through numerical integration. Fortunately, STCM approximation and modal extraction can be performed offline. WIMO provides DOA estimation without the conventional prerequisites, such as spectral decomposition, focusing procedure and, a priori information on the number of sources and their DOAs. Several numerical examples are conducted to compare the WIMO performance with the state-of-the-art methods. Simulations demonstrate that the two proposed DOA estimators achieve superior performance in terms of probability of resolution and estimation error along with orders of magnitude runtime speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broadband DOA estimation using Convolutional neural networks trained with noise signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00919v2)** | 2017-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A convolution neural network (CNN) based classification method for broadband DOA estimation is proposed, where the phase component of the short-time Fourier transform coefficients of the received microphone signals are directly fed into the CNN and the features required for DOA estimation are learnt during training. Since only the phase component of the input is used, the CNN can be trained with synthesized noise signals, thereby making the preparation of the training data set easier compared to using speech signals. Through experimental evaluation, the ability of the proposed noise trained CNN framework to generalize to speech sources is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of the system to noise, small perturbations in microphone positions, as well as its ability to adapt to different acoustic conditions is investigated using experiments with simulated and real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2017</p></details> |
